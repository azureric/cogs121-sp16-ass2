# App Name: Crash Vis
Our California Highway Patrol officers work hard to assure the safe, convenient and efficient
transportation of people and goods on our highway system.  With a massively expansive highway
system and a limited amount of resources, CHP officers are faced with the problem of how they
can position themselves in the most strategic places to prevent and respond to motor vehicle collisions.
This is where Crash Vis comes in.  Our application is capable of visualizing real-time statistics
on motor vehicle collisions in a way that can be easily interpreted by officers to help them identify
problem areas on the road.  The easier it is for our officers to see the problem, the easier it is
for them to control traffic and prevent collisions.

#Design Principles:

**Discoverability/Signifiers**
- Are users able to easily find the points of the application that they are interested in?

**Learnability**
- Are users able to easily learn and remember how to interact with your application?

**Feedback**
- Is there strong evidence of user feedback for actionable items?

**Natural Mapping/Mental Metaphors**
- Is there strong evidence of providing natural mappings or relatable metaphors that help
the user navigate the application?

**Constraints**
- Does the application have deliberate constraints to guide the flow of user interaction?

**Error Prevention/Recovery**
- Is there strong evidence of error prevention and error recovery so that the user wonâ€™t be
left confused when something unexpected happens?
